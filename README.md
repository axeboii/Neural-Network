# NeuralNetwork_SA115X
This repository contains files associated with Degree Project in Vehicle Engineering "Implementation and Optimisation of a Neural Network".
Authors: Axel Boivie <aboivie@kth.se>, Victor Bellander <vicbel@kth.se>

Implementation: This folder contains file related to just the implementation of the network. In order to change parameters used, changes can be made to either global variables in "Network.py" or parameters in "main.py".

Visualisation: This folder contains the same files as Implementation, with some modifications in order to save and later visualise results. Also, a matlab program "visualiseData.m" is found here, which has different sections to visualise different data. It relies on a function file "smoothen.m" as well as a "/results" folder, containing correctly named data files.
