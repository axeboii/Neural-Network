# NeuralNetwork_SA115X
This repository contains files associated with Degree Project in Vehicle Engineering "Implementation and Optimisation of a Neural Network".
Authors: Axel Boivie <aboivie@kth.se>, Victor Bellander <vicbel@kth.se>

Implementation: This folder contains files with an implementation of a neural network in python. In order to change parameters, either global variables in "Network.py" or parameters in "main.py" can be modified.

Visualisation: This folder contains the same files as Implementation, with some modifications in order to save and later visualise results. Also, a matlab program "visualiseData.m" is found here, which has different sections to visualise different data. It relies on a function file "smoothen.m" as well as a "/results" folder, containing correctly named data files.
